                <p><span></span>Growth is a fundamental aspect of human nature. We are used to increasing the space around us, to crossing borders, to thinking of and discovering unexpected grounds.</p>
                <p><span></span>In this fertile environment of constant change, shutdown confronts us with new levels of restriction and limitation. Country borders are closed, private life reduced to a minimum and cultural life locked in silence. The question
                    "What's new?" is increasingly left unanswered and so are the contents that used to stimulate our thoughts and conversations.</p>

                <p><span></span>Based on the idea to use limitation as a creative tool instead of declaring it as constraint, Seeu.gallery aims to rethink existing concepts and to reestablish focus in a world of distraction. Every week, there will be
                    a new exhibition with an artist whose work moves the world of art and design and thus maintains the fertile environment of constant change.</p>

                        was held mostly online and non-physical. Everybody gained insight into digital design strategies by delving into Grasshopper, a Rhino 3D tool for parametric design.
                        <p>Within a short design sprint the students created a series of objects that have one thing in common: holes. When is a hole a hole? How holey can an object be? The results are exhibited in the Shutdown Gallery.</div>
